# Thread-Downloader

This tiny application will simply download all the images/webms in a thread and either download them to the directory where the application sits
or a specified location. The application will walk you through on the specifics of using the tool.

HOW TO USE
======================
  - First download Python 3 (uploading a Python 2 version of the application soon)
  - Once Python has been installed, make sure that you have the PYTHON environment variable set
  - In the command line, navigate to the directory where the tool is installed.
    - Alternatively open the command line in the directory where the tool sits.
  - Type python ./threadDownloader.py
  - Follow the steps and enjoy

KNOWN ERRORS
======================

Some known errors include:
  - Occasionally will get an SSL error, looking into this. In case of this, just re-launch the tool and it will download the     remainder of the images

FUTURE FEATURES
======================

  - A live update feature, where the tool will continue to download images and they are uploaded and end when all the images        have been downloaded and the thread has been archived.
